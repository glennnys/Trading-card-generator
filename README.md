Running GUI2.py will allow the editing and generation with visual interface of one card.

Following functionality is now supported:

mouse side buttons will go back and forth between card editor and new card select. (not on linux)

CTRL-Z, CTRL-Y and CTRL-S will do probably exactly what you expect.

Typing any asset image name in a textfield with following structure ":asset:" will insert the asset in the text (as a square). See the list of useful assets (card assets.pdf) or look in the database. (spaces should be replaced by underscores)
