Running GUI2.py will allow the editing and generation with visual interface of one card.
To generate all cards from "card files" can be done by running make card.py

Following functionality is now supported:
mouse side buttons will go back an forth between card editor and new card select. (not on linux)
CTRL-Z, CTRL-Y and CTRL-S will do probably exactly what you expect.
Typing any asset image name in a textfield with following structure ":asset:" will insert the asset in the text (as a square). See the list of useful assets or look in the database. (spaces should be replaced by underscores)
